    "Life expectancy is one of the most important metrics to use when assessing the health of a certain population. It is the average age of when one dies in that population. Throughout history there has been a relationship between developed countries and higher life expectancies (Roser, Ortiz-Ospina, and Ritchie). Richer countries have more resources available and larger government budgets which can all contribute to higher life expectancies. More developed countries also have the ability to take advantage of their resources through improved healthcare systems and initiatives. Therefore we wanted to research what underdeveloped countries can do to help acheive higher life expectancies. Using data from around the world, we wanted to determine which factors were most associated with life expectancy in order to inform developing nations how to best use their limited resources to improve their population's life expectancies."

    "One of the most important jobs for governments to execute is to improve the life expectancy of their citizens. Therefore it is crucial for governments to develop ways to improve life expectancy. Furthermore, many countries, especially developing ones, have constrained budgets, and need to be able to improve life expectancy in the most efficient ways possible. Therefore we are exploring the best ways in which governments and health organizations can most efficiently target the factors related to life expectancy to best improve it. We plan to do so through linear regression model while focusing on inference and the relationship between our predictors and life expectancy. "
