    "Life expectancy is one of the most important metrics to use when assessing the health of a certain population. It is the average age of when one dies in that population. Throughout history there has been a relationship between developed countries and higher life expectancies (Roser, Ortiz-Ospina, and Ritchie). Richer countries have more resources available and larger government budgets which can all contribute to higher life expectancies. More developed countries also have the ability to take advantage of their resources through improved healthcare systems and initiatives. Therefore we wanted to research what underdeveloped countries can do to help acheive higher life expectancies. Using data from around the world, we wanted to determine which factors were most associated with life expectancy in order to inform developing nations how to best use their limited resources to improve their population's life expectancies."

    "One of the most important jobs for governments to execute is to improve the life expectancy of their citizens. Therefore it is crucial for governments to develop ways to improve life expectancy. Furthermore, many countries, especially developing ones, have constrained budgets, and need to be able to improve life expectancy in the most efficient ways possible. Therefore we are exploring the best ways in which governments and health organizations can most efficiently target the factors related to life expectancy to best improve it. We plan to do so through linear regression model while focusing on inference and the relationship between our predictors and life expectancy. "

This is especially important for countries such as developing countries that have limited amounts to spend. These governments need to identify which specific factors are most correlated with improving life expectancy to best understand how to efficiently allocate their resources. Other stakeholders include health organizations that can assist with advising these governments. By discovering which predictors are important and have the greatest impact on life expectancy, these organizations will have a better understanding of when and how to intervene. Lastly, individual people are stakeholders as well.

The rest of the dataset had a very small number of missing values dispersed over a few different variables-- we dropped these rows as well. These rows were less significant since there were very few of them.\n",

This change filtered out a number of rows of data that had likely been mis-inputted.\n",

    "We chose a linear regression model with a focus on inference rather than prediction. This is because it is likely more important for a government to want to know which factors have the greatest effect on life expectancy rather than predicting an exact life expectancy. Therefore, they can focus on minimizing or maximizing the effect of certain predictors instead of just predicting what their life expectancy may be. In order to find the most helpful predictors, we focused on minimizing RMSE, maximizing R-squared, and making sure that each predictor was statistically significant in the final model. We followed a traditional approach of subset selection and later adding transformations and interactions that is detailed below in the \"Developing the Model\" section. However, we ran into some issues with messy data and multicollinearity that we were able to fix with EDA, data cleaning, and VIF analysis. Another problem we faced was balancing the interpretability of the model with adding the transformations and interactions that reduced RMSE and increased R-squared the most. We found that adding several transformaions and interactions helped the most with RMSE and R-squared but made it difficult to understand which predictors were responsible for affecting life expectancy and the magnitude of their effect. Therefore, we chose a model that was not our lowest RMSE and highest R-squared but still had relatively low RMSE and relatively high R-squared as well as being intrepretable."

After creating a new variable, continent, by categorizing each observation by their country into their respective continents, we added continent as a predictor to the model. This improved the model by reducing RMSE to 2.845 and increasing R-squared to .926."

When considering our stakeholders and what they would be looking for, we found out that it may be hard to draw conclusions about the effects of specific predictors when they have had multiple transformations.

We chose to sacrifice some R-squared and RMSE because we are focused on inference rather than prediction. Additionally, each of the predictors were still statistically significant. Lastly, we found that the train RSE was 3.388 for this model which was very similar to the test RMSE. This indicates that there was not overfitting."

Given the fact that public health dangers -- like poverty, starvation, and disease -- are relatively constant in their effects on a population, our model should be able to work for decades to come. As we have stated, our model provides the most value to developing countries in particular, and the inferences that these nations could make based on our model will hold true for a long period of time.

    "We believe that our final model provides vital information to our stakeholders on how they should allocate their limited resources. The majority of this information falls in the public health sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking into vaccination rates for different diseases, our stakeholders can make the important decision on how to spend their public health budget. Looking at diphtheria vaccination percentage in Africa, the coefficient on this variable was 0.0562. For polio vaccination rates, on the other hand, the coefficient was 0.0179. This means that diphtheria vaccination in Africa was more than 3 times more effective at increasing life expectancy than polio vaccination. Obviously, developing nations should consult with their own public health officials change policy in a way that uniquely fits their own country. However, for an African nation with a limited budget needing to pick between the most effective vaccine, our model allows them to do so. Another valuable change that we added to our model was an interaction variable between diphtheria and continent. Now, when we consider dipheria rates in the Americas, the coefficient falls to 0.0148. Not only have we shown that the Americas are less significantly affected by diphtheria than Africa -- something that most people likely knew -- but we have concrete evidence for the fact that it is severe at a similar rate to polio. For developing nations in the Americas, they could use this information to dictate their budgets as well.\n",

    "One of the strongest coefficients we had was the HIV/AIDs variable, which had a coefficient of -0.4475. This variable measured deaths caused by HIV/AIDs per 1,000 live births in a nation. In this case, most developed nations had extremely low values for this variable. However, for each increase in one death per 1,000 live births, the average life expectancy of a nation should expect to drop by about -0.45 years. This variable overall is indicative of the prevalence of HIV/AIDs in a nation overall, since children get the virus in the womb from their mothers being infected. By demonstrating the severe impact of this disease, our stakeholders should place combatting HIV/AIDs as one of their top public health priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we knew that economic variables like gdp_per_capita were correlated with life expectancy, we also included these in our model. However, since all nations are constantly fighting to increase their wealth already, our model does not provide valuable feedback in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, given updated data every few years, our model has no clear date where it will become obsolete. In the long term, if global poverty were to subsist, then our stakeholders would no longer exist. However, this does not seem unrealistic any time soon. In the mean time, we believe that our stakeholders -- underdeveloped nations and organizations looking to aid them -- can gain lots of valuable information from our model."
