    "**The problem we want to explore is what factors make a movie successful. There are many decisions that go into making a movie such as who to hire as actors, directors, etc., how much to spend on production, how much to spend on advertising and so on. Some of the reasoning behind hiring actors or directors could be due to their popularity and social media prescence. We will investigate these factors to determine a model that best predicts the success of a movie using gross revenue as the measure of success. This is a regression problem because the response variable is a continous variable. We are interested in the response variable of gross revenue. This is a prediction problem because we want to predict the revenue a movie will generate based on certain factors. As a regression problem, we’ll look to minimize RMSE because lower values of RMSE indicate a better fit. We chose to look at RMSE over MAE because we want to penalize large errors in predicting gross revenue more. This is because we believe large differences in revenue should be considered more than a few dollars. Additionally, we will try to maximize R2 in order to make sure our model is able to explain as much of the variation in the data without overfitting. We can check for this overfitting by making sure that our training RSE isn’t too low and test RMSE isn’t too high relative to one another. We also may need to consider variable interaction to improve our model. For example, certain combinations of actors and directors may make for a more profitable movie. Increasing revenue with an increase in actor popularity may also depend on an increase in director popularity. Additionally, some variables may need to be transformed. For example, if gross revenue for all movies dipped in certain years and rose in others, a quadratic relationship may be better to model the data than linear. We can check if the linearity assumption is met using residual plots. Also we might need to remove some of our variables using variable selection techniques.**"

Our results must also have a low enough RMSE that movie executives could rely on it when evaluating a film— if the confidence interval is too large of a range, then it provides very little insight since the studio could be making a very large or very small amount of money and it would not know which is likely.
